        <h2>J. Robert Oppenheimer: The Father of the Atomic Bomb</h2>
        <img class="oppenheimer-img" src="imgs/image.png" alt="" />
        <p class="details">
          J. Robert Oppenheimer was an American theoretical physicist who is
          often credited as the "father of the atomic bomb." He was born in New
          York City in 1904 and grew up in a wealthy and cultured household.
          Oppenheimer was a brilliant student and excelled in physics,
          mathematics, and poetry. He attended Harvard University, where he
          graduated summa cum laude in 1925.
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          After graduating from Harvard, Oppenheimer went on to study at the
          University of Cambridge in England. He then returned to the United
          States to work as a research assistant at the California Institute of
          Technology. In 1929, Oppenheimer was awarded a Ph.D. in physics from
          the University of California, Berkeley.
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          After completing his Ph.D., Oppenheimer held a number of academic
          positions, including a professorship at the University of California,
          Berkeley. In 1942, he was recruited to work on the Manhattan Project,
          the top-secret U.S. government project to develop the atomic bomb.
          Oppenheimer was appointed director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in New
          Mexico, where he oversaw the development of the bomb.
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          The atomic bomb was successfully tested in New Mexico in July 1945.
          Two atomic bombs were then dropped on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima
          and Nagasaki, leading to the end of World War II. After the war,
          Oppenheimer became a vocal critic of the development of nuclear
          weapons. He warned of the dangers of nuclear proliferation and called
          for international control of nuclear weapons.
        </p>
        <p class="details">
          Oppenheimer died in 1967 at the age of 62. He is remembered as one of
          the most brilliant physicists of his generation, and his legacy
          continues to be debated today.
